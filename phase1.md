What you’ve already set up
CI/CD workflow: 
.github/workflows/deploy.yml
 runs on push to main/master and via manual dispatch with action input (start|stop|status).
Node/Playwright setup: Uses Node 18, caches Playwright, installs Chromium (npx playwright install chromium --with-deps).
Test execution: Runs npx playwright test tests/main.spec.js --project=chromium during the workflow.
Job timeout: Configured timeout-minutes: 1440 (note: GitHub-hosted runners hard-cap ~6h regardless).
Manual paths: start|status|stop branches echo info; start still just runs the same one-time Playwright command.
Current behavior on deploy (push)
Starts a workflow run, installs deps, runs Playwright tests once.
Outcome:
Green check if tests pass.
Red X if tests fail.
If tests hang, the run eventually times out (≈6h on GitHub-hosted).
Does not keep running 24/7; the run completes after tests finish.
Email reporting system
Report generator: 
TestData/email_reporter.js
logTestResult()
: collects results.
generateEmailReport()
: builds HTML.
sendHourlyReport()
: sends via Nodemailer (uses EMAIL_USER, EMAIL_PASS, REPORT_EMAIL).
Test harness: 
test_email.js
 validates SMTP, adds sample results, and sends a test report.
What the screenshot shows
Successful run: “PIR Sensor Scheduler – 24/7 Automation System” completed green in ~1m 48s.
Another run with info icon: completed without failure (likely echo/status steps).
Notable gaps vs. true 24/7
Workflow doesn’t loop or schedule recurring runs; no schedule: cron trigger.
“Stop” action doesn’t cancel anything; it only echoes and ends that invocation.
24/7 continuous running would require a self-hosted runner with a loop, or a cron schedule to re-run periodically.
